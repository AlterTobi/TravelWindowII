A new version is available!

Sorting through drag and drop and locking the window positions go hand in hand - by locking the interface in place you are preventing accidental drag and drops.

v2.4.0

- add: newly learned skills will be detected automatically and become visible and usable in TW II
- add: new option to use skill name as label instead of location name
- add: incorporated RU translations by Svertalf
- add: new options tab with list of still learnable travel skills
- add: acquisition method for skills on still learnable skills tab (beta, EN only)
- enhance: checkboxes in options now have better labels so checkbox marked means "turned on"
- enhance: minor improvements to main window solving, mostly fixing scaling issues
