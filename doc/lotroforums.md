A new version is available!

v1.0.29alpha
- fixed Mariner skills showing up twice in DE client
- adding U38 skills support for EN/FR client

There is a bug with the skills returning you to Dol Amroth - the skills are named identically by SSG and I need to see if this can be fixed. I will look into that together with the next update that will add support for the DE client.
